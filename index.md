## Welcome to my coding projects website

I am a Computer Science major, currently attending the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I enjoy programming, video games, writing, playing drums, and learning new things. The languages I have worked with are Python, C++, Java, C#, and SQL. On this website I will be showing my projects that I work on throughout my time at UMKC as well as in my spare time.

## Breakout

This is a version of Breakout that I have programmed in C#. I intend on expanding upon it in the future.

## Nine Men's Morris

This project is for my CS 449 class. We have been tasked with creating our own version of Nine Men's Morris. My group and I have created a version that allows for human vs computer and human vs human gameplay.

## Parking Lot Manager

This project was to help us understand how databases work and how they can be interacted with. The entirety of this code is my own work, and as a result, the project is only completed up to a certain point. My group members did not do their part of the assignment, so this code is still incomplete. I would like to go back and finish it at some point.

## C++ Calendar

This is just a simple C++ calendar program I am working on. I started it as a way to expand upon my knowledge of C++. I still have more to add to it.

## Collaborative Projects

These projects are small, simple projects that my friends and I worked on for school
