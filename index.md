## Welcome to my coding projects website

I am a Computer Science major, currently attending the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I enjoy programming, video games, writing, playing drums, and learning new things. On this website I will be showing my projects that I work on throughout my time at UMKC as well as in my spare time.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Bobbyjuba/bobbyjuba.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
